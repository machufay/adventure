Unlike humans, who are bound by hesitation, fatigue, and moral restraint, such a weaponized machine operates with mechanical precision, instant response time, and an unwavering purpose. It doesn't flinch under pressure, second-guess its actions, or suffer the psychological toll of violence. In a contest of raw firepower, reaction speed, and ruthlessness, our soft tissue and conflicted minds are outclassed by a vehicle designed for pure, unthinking dominance. Against such a machine, our evolution of flesh and conscience becomes less an asset and more a vulnerability.</h1>
